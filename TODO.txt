1 Test parser competency headers with 10, 11 digits
2 Rewrite competencies render at NumeratedListView - only 3 level of competencies must be rendered,
see TODO in NumeratedListView#renderCompetencies for details
3 Add errors support(Either) in controller methods and show error to user if it occurred
4 Add version or hash of source file at export results. This will be helpful in future if export
results will be compared and knowledges were computed from 2 different competency source files, so
diff will be incorrect in some way
5 Add popup info on vailed input validation
